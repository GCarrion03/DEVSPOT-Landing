                    <p style="text-align: justify;">For this test I recommend studying for at least 4 weeks. Using the
                        first 15 days take the <a target="_blank"

                        <a href="./mytrack/SOA-C01.html" target="_blank">"My Track" section</a>, do this daily. After
                        you complete all the simulator questions do an "All My Incorrect Questions" test.
                        Once Your track is complete (My Track - Overall score > 80%) take the final exam readiness test
                        by doing an Exam mode Assessment (you can get a pdf certificate!), once you pass
                        this exam you will be ready to take the official aws certification exam.

                    <p class="bold">My thoughts right after taking this exam:</p>
                    <div style="padding-left: 1em;">
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">I took the &quot;a cloud guru&quot; preparation, the
                            explanations are on point but it felt a bit repetitive since I also took the SAA-C02 on
                            their platform and ~60% of the content is shared between these 2 courses, also lacked the
                            depth that the practice tests required, then went ahead and started to gather some practice
                            questions from the web unaware that most of them were related to the old exam(SOA-C00) I
                            started to answer them and noted a huge number of trick questions, some requested very
                            irrelevant numbers that you needed to memorize I&#39;m glad they scrapped this format, also
                            found some more up to date questions(SOA-C01) which were way easier to read and answer.</p>
                        <p><strong>Difficulty: </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Harder than Solutions Architect A.(926/1000) easier than Developer A.(862/1000)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of difficulty, I would rank it second behind the
                            SysOps Admin Associate exam but harder than the SAA-C02, in my opinion, this is no longer
                            the
                            hardest AWS exam as it used to be, In the legacy practice tests I couldn&#39;t go above 60%
                            while in the new version I could easily score above 80%, I do not recommend doing this but
                            it gave me more insight about the evolution of AWS and the huge steps they&#39;ve taken
                            towards simplicity and usability.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Exam: </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remote with Pearson Vue no issues 40+ mins unused</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As I suspected all the SOA-C00 questions style were gone, felt like I was retaking Solutions
                            Architect Associate but each question had 1 or 2 somewhat correct but not optimal solutions
                            that might confuse you, Pearson Vue check-in was smooth, the exam started right on time.</p>
