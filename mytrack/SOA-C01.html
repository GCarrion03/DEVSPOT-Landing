                    A Security team is concerned about the potential of intellectual property leaking to the internet. A SysOps Administrator is tasked with identifying controls to address the potential problem. The servers in question reside in a VPC and cannot be allowed to send traffic to the internet. How can these requirements be met? A SysOps Administrator is writing a utility that publishes resources from an AWS Lambda function in AWS Account A to an Amazon S3 bucket in AWS Account B. The Lambda function is able to successfully write new objects to the S3 bucket, but IAM users in Account B are unable to delete objects written to the bucket by Account A.  Which step will fix this issue? A SysOps Administrator is troubleshooting an AWS CloudFormation template whereby multiple Amazon EC2 instances are being created. The template is working in us-east-1, but it is failing in us-west-2 with the error code: AMI [ami-12345678] does not exist How should the Administrator ensure that the AWS CloudFormation template is working in every region? An organization is concerned that its Amazon RDS databases are not protected. The solution to address this issue must be low cost, protect against table corruption that could be overlooked for several days, and must offer a 30-day window of protection. How can these requirements be met? A company has created a separate AWS account for all development work to protect the production environment. In this development account, developers have permission to manipulate IAM policies and roles. Corporate policies require that developers are blocked from accessing some services. What is the BEST way to grant the developers privileges in the development account while still complying with corporate policies? After a network change, application servers cannot connect to the corresponding Amazon RDS MySQL database. What should the SysOps Administrator analyze? A SysOps Administrator stores crash dump files in Amazon S3. New security and privacy measures require that crash dumps older than 6 months be deleted. Which approach meets this requirement? After launching a new Amazon EC2 instance from a Microsoft Windows 2012 Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the SysOps Administrator is unable to connect to the instance using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The instance is also unreachable. As part of troubleshooting, the Administrator deploys a second instance from a different AMI using the same configuration and is able to connect to the instance. What should be the next logical step in troubleshooting the first instance? An organization finds that a high number of gp2 Amazon EBS volumes are running out of space. Which solution will provide the LEAST disruption with MINIMAL effort? A SysOps Administrator created an AWS Service Catalog portfolio and shared the portfolio with a second AWS account in the company. The second account is controlled by a different Administrator. Which action will the Administrator of the second account be able to perform? A SysOps Administrator is responsible for a legacy, CPU-heavy application. The application can only be scaled vertically. Currently, the application is deployed on a single t2.large Amazon EC2 instance. The system is showing 90% CPU usage and significant performance latency after a few minutes. What change should be made to alleviate the performance problem? An organization has two AWS accounts: Development and Production. A SysOps Administrator manages access of IAM users to both accounts. Some IAM users in Development should have access to certain resources in Production. How can this be accomplished? A company is setting up a VPC peering connection between its VPC and a customer’s VPC. The company VPC is an IPv4 CIDR block of 172.16.0.0/16, and the customer’s is an IPv4 CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16. The SysOps Administrator wants to be able to ping the customer’s database private IP address from one of the company’s Amazon EC2 instances. What action should be taken to meet the requirements? A company hosts its website on Amazon ECF2 instances behind an ELB Application Load Balancer. The company manages its DNS with Amazon Route 53, and wants to point its domain’s zone apex to the website. Which type of record should be used to meet these requirements? According to the shared responsibility model, for which of the following Amazon EC2 activities is AWS responsible? (Choose two.) A SysOps Administrator must ensure all Amazon EBS volumes currently in use, and those created in the future, are encrypted with a specific AWS KMS customer master key (CMK). What is the MOST efficient way for the Administrator to meet this requirement? A SysOps Administrator is receiving multiple reports from customers that they are unable to connect to the company’s website. which is being served through Amazon CloudFront. Customers are receiving HTTP response codes for both 4XX and 5XX errors. Which metric can the Administrator use to monitor the elevated error rates in CloudFront? During a security investigation, it is determined that there is a coordinated attack on the web applications deployed on Amazon EC2. The attack is performed through malformed HTTP headers. What AWS service of feature would prevent this traffic from reaching the EC2 instances? A SysOps Administrator must find a way to set up alerts when Amazon EC2 service limits are close to being reached. How can the Administrator achieve this requirement? A SysOps Administrator is using AWS KMS with AWS-generated key material to encrypt an Amazon EBS volume in a company’s AWS environment. The Administrator wants to rotate the KMS keys using automatic key rotation, and needs to ensure that the EBS volume encrypted with the current key remains readable. What should be done to accomplish this? A SysOps Administrator is managing an AWS account where Developers are authorized to launch Amazon EC2 instances to test new code. To limit costs, the Administrator must ensure that the EC2 instances in the account are terminated 24 hours after launch. How should the Administrator meet these requirements? A SysOps Administrator is implementing SSL for a domain of an internet-facing application running behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The Administrator decides to use an SSL certificate from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) to secure it. Upon creating a request for the ALB fully qualified domain name (FQDN), it fails, and the error message “Domain Not Allowed” is displayed. How can the Administrator fix this issue? In configuring an Amazon Route 53 health check, a SysOps Administrator selects ‘Yes’ to the String Matching option in the Advanced Configuration section. In the Search String box, the Administrator types the following text: /html. This is to ensure that the entire page is loading during the health check. Within 5 minutes of enabling the health check, the Administrator receives an alert stating that the check failed. However, when the Administrator navigates to the page, it loads successfully. What is the MOST likely cause of this false alarm? The networking team has created a VPC in an AWS account. The application team has asked for access to resources in another VPC in the same AWS account. The SysOps Administrator has created the VPC peering connection between both the accounts, but the resources in one VPC cannot communicate with the resources in the other VPC. What could be causing this issue? The Security team has decided that there will be no public internet access to HTTP (TCP port 80) because it is moving to HTTPS for all incoming web traffic. The team has asked a SysOps Administrator to provide a report on any security groups that are not compliant. What should the SysOps Administrator do to provide near real-time compliance reporting? A SysOps Administrator responsible for an e-commerce web application observes the application does not launch new Amazon EC2 instances at peak times, even though the maximum capacity of the Auto Scaling group has not been reached. What should the Administrator do to identify the underlying problem? (Choose two.) An organization would like to set up an option for its Developers to receive an email whenever production Amazon EC2 instances are running over 80% CPU utilization. How can this be accomplished using an Amazon CloudWatch alarm? After a particularly high AWS bill, an organization wants to review the use of AWS services. What AWS service will allow the SysOps Administrator to quickly view this information to share it, and will also forecast expenses for the current billing period? A company is deploying a legacy web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an ELB Application Load Balancer. The application worked well in the test environment. However, in production, users report that they are prompted to log in to the system several times an hour. Which troubleshooting step should be taken to help resolve the problem reported by users? A SysOps Administrator is tasked with deploying and managing a single CloudFormation template across multiple AWS accounts. What feature of AWS CloudFormation will accomplish this? An existing data management application is running on a single Amazon EC2 instance and needs to be moved to a new AWS Region in another AWS account. How can a SysOps Administrator achieve this while maintaining the security of the application?  A SysOps Administrator noticed that the cache hit ratio for an Amazon CloudFront distribution is less than 10%. Which collection of configuration changes will increase the cache hit ratio for the distribution? (Choose two.) An application accesses data through a file system interface. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones, all of which must share the same data. While the amount of data is currently small, the company anticipates that it will grow to tens of terabytes over the lifetime of the application. What is the MOST scalable storage solution to fulfill the requirement? A company’s application stores documents within an Amazon S3 bucket. The application is running on Amazon EC2 in a VPC. A recent change in security requirements states that traffic between the company’s application and the S3 bucket must never leave the Amazon network. What AWS feature can provide this functionality? An application running on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones was deployed using an AWS CloudFormation template. The SysOps team has patched the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) version and must update all the EC2 instances to use the new AMI. How can the SysOps Administrator use CloudFormation to apply the new AMI while maintaining a minimum level of active instances to ensure service continuity? A SysOps Administrator deployed an AWS Elastic Beanstalk worker node environment that reads messages from an auto-generated Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and deletes them from the queue after processing. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scales in and scales out the number of worker nodes based on CPU utilization. After some time, the Administrator notices that the number of messages in the SQS queue are increasing significantly. Which action will remediate this issue? A company has 50 AWS accounts and wants to create an identical Amazon VPC in each account. Any changes the company makes to the VPCs in the future must be implemented on every VPC. What is the SIMPLEST method to deploy and update the VPCs in each account? A SysOps Administrator is deploying a website with dynamic content. Company policy requires that users from certain countries or regions cannot access the web content and should receive an error page. Which of the following can be used to implement this policy? (Choose two.) After installing and configuring the Amazon CloudWatch agent on an EC2 instance, the anticipated system logs are not being received by CloudWatch Logs. Which of the following are likely to be the cause of this problem? (Choose two.) A SysOps Administrator launched an Amazon EC2 instance and received a message that the service limit was exceeded for that instance type. What action should the Administrator take to ensure that EC2 instances can be launched? A company has adopted a security policy that requires all customer data to be encrypted at rest. Currently, customer data is stored on a central Amazon EFS file system and accessed by a number of different applications from Amazon EC2 instances. How can the SysOps Administrator ensure that all customer data stored on the EFS file system meets the new requirement? A company has mandated the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users, and requires users to make all API-calls using the CLI. However, users are not prompted to enter MFA tokens, and are able to run CLI commands without MFA. In an attempt to enforce MFA, the company attached an IAM policy to all users that denies API calls that have not been authenticated with MFA. What additional step must be taken to ensure that API calls are authenticated using MFA? A web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancing Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. A SysOps Administrator has notice that some EC2 instances show up healthy in the Auto Scaling console but show up as unhealthy in the ALB target console. What could be the issue? A company with dozens of AWS accounts wants to ensure that governance rules are being applied across all accounts. The CIO has recommended that AWS Config rules be deployed using an AWS CloudFormation template. How should these requirements be met? A company’s use of AWS Cloud services is quickly growing, so a SysOps Administrator has been asked to generate details of daily spending to share with management. Which method should the Administrator choose to produce this data? A company has centralized all its logs into one Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. The SysOps Administrator is to alert different teams of any issues relevant to them. What is the MOST efficient approach to accomplish this? A company is deploying a web service to Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer. All resources will be defined and created in a single AWS CloudFormation stack using a template. The creation of each EC2 instance will not be considered complete until an initialization script has been run successfully on the EC2 instance. The Elastic Load Balancer cannot be created until all EC2 instances have been created. Which CloudFormation resource will coordinate the Elastic Load Balancer creation in the CloudFormation stack template? A company is concerned about a security vulnerability impacting its Linux operating system. What should the SysOps Administrator do to alleviate this concern? An Applications team has successfully deployed an AWS CloudFormation stack consisting of 30 t2-medium Amazon EC2 instances in the us-west-2 Region. When using the same template to launch a stack in useast- 2, the launch failed and rolled back after launching only 10 EC2 instances. What is a possible cause of this failure? A company has multiple web applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The EC2 instances require connectivity to the internet for patching purposes, but cannot be publicly accessible. Which step will meet these requirements? A SysOps Administrator is required to monitor free space on Amazon EBS volumes attached to Microsoft Windows-based Amazon EC2 instances within a company’s account. The Administrator must be alerted to potential issues. What should the Administrator do to receive email alerts before low storage space affects EC2 instance performance? An organization has decided to consolidate storage and move all of its backups and archives to Amazon S3. With all of the data gathered into a hierarchy under a single directory, the organization determines there is 70 TB of data that needs to be uploaded. The organization currently has a 150-Mbps connection with 10 people working at the location. Which service would be the MOST efficient way to transfer this data to Amazon S3? A SysOps Administrator created an AWS CloudFormation template for the first time. The stack failed with a status of ROLLBACK_COMPLETE. The Administrator identified and resolved the template issue causing the failure. How should the Administrator continue with the stack deployment?

What will minimize latency by reducing load on the S3 bucket? A Systems Administrator is responsible for maintaining custom, approved AMIs for a company. These AMIs must be shared with each of the company’s AWS accounts. How can the Administrator address this issue? Based on the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following actions are the responsibility of the customer for an Aurora database? A SysOps Administrator is running an auto-scaled application behind a Classic Load Balancer. Scaling out is triggered when the CPUUtilization instance metric is more than 75% across the Auto Scaling group. The Administrator noticed aggressive scaling out and after discussing with developers, an application memory leak is suspected causing aggressive garbage collection cycle. How can the Administrator troubleshoot the application without triggering the scaling process? A company’s data retention policy dictates that backups be stored for exactly two years. After that time, the data must be deleted. How can Amazon EBS snapshots be managed to conform to this data retention policy? Development teams are maintaining several workloads on AWS. Company management is concerned about rising costs and wants the SysOps Administrator to configure alerts so teams are notified when spending approaches preset limits. Which AWS service will satisfy these requirements?  A SysOps Administrator receives a connection timeout error when attempting to connect to an Amazon EC2 instance from a home network using SSH. The Administrator was able to connect to this EC2 instance using from their office network in the past. What caused the connection to time out? An organization created an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume with a file system ID of fs- 85ba41fc, and it is actively used by 10 Amazon EC2 hosts.

All the devices need to be managed centrally, and their configurations need to be consistent. What is the BEST service for managing these devices? A SysOps Administrator found that a newly-deployed Amazon EC2 application server is unable to connect to an existing Amazon RDS database. After enabling VPC Flow Logs and confirming that the flow log is active on the console, the log group cannot be located in Amazon CloudWatch. What are the MOST likely reasons for this situation? (Choose two.) Company A purchases Company B and inherits three new AWS accounts. Company A would like to centralize billing and Reserved Instance benefits but wants to keep all other resources separate. How can this be accomplished? A SysOps Administrator manages a website running on Amazon EC2 instances behind an ELB Application Load Balancer. Users visiting the load balancer’s DNS address in a browser are reporting errors. The administrator has confirmed: The security groups and network ACLs are correctly configured. The load balancer target group shows no healthy instances. What should the Administrator do to resolve this issue? An organization has been running their website on several m2 Linux instances behind a Classic Load Balancer for more than two years. Traffic and utilization have been constant and predictable.  What should the organization do to reduce costs? A company received its latest bill with a large increase in the number of requests against Amazon SQS as compared to the month prior. The company is not aware of any changes in its SQS usage. The company is concerned about the cost increase and who or what was making these calls. What should the SysOps Administrator use to validate the calls made to SQS? A SysOpsAdministrator is managing a large organization with multiple accounts on the Business Support plan all linked to a single payer account. The Administrator wants to be notified automatically of AWS Personal Health Dashboard events. In the main payer account, the Administrator configures Amazon CloudWatch Events triggered by AWS Health events triggered by AWS Health triggered by AWS Health events to issue notifications using Amazon SNS, but alerts in the linked accounts failed to trigger. Why did the alerts fail? A company creates custom AMI images by launching new Amazon EC2 instances from an AWS CloudFormation template. It installs and configures necessary software through AWS OpsWorks, and takes images of each EC2 instance. The process of installing and configuring software can take between 2 to 3 hours, but at times, the process stalls due to installation errors. The SysOps Administrator must modify the CloudFormation template so if the process stalls, the entire stack will fail and roll back. Based on these requirements, what should be added to the template? A company recently implemented an Amazon S3 lifecycle rule that accidentally deleted objects from one of its S3 buckets. The bucket has S3 versioning enabled. Which actions will restore the objects? (Choose two.) A company uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy its application infrastructure. Recently, a user accidentally changed a property of a database in a CloudFormation template and performed a stack update that caused an interruption to the application.

What EBS volume type will be the MOST cost-effective solution? A company uses multiple accounts for its applications. Account A manages the company’s Amazon Route 53 domains and hosted zones. Account B uses a load balancer fronting the company’s web servers. How can the company use Route 53 to point to the load balancer in the MOST cost-effective and efficient manner? A SysOps Administrator is managing a Memcached cluster in Amazon ElastiCache. The cluster has been heavily used recently, and the Administrator wants to use a larger instance type with more memory. What should the Administrator use to make this change? An application is being developed that will be served across a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances, which require a consistent view of persistent data. Items stored vary in size from 1KB to 300MB; the items are read frequently, created occasionally, and often require partial changes without conflict. The data store is not expected to grow beyond 2TB, and items will be expired according to age and content type. Which AWS service solution meets these requirements? When the AWS Cloud infrastructure experiences an event that may impact an organization, which AWS service can be used to see which of the organization’s resources are affected? An Auto Scaling group scales up and down based on Average CPU Utilization. The alarm is set to trigger a scaling event when the Average CPU Utilization exceeds 80% for 5 minutes. Currently, the Average CPU has been 95% for over two hours and new instances are not being added. What could be the issue? An application is running on multiple EC2 instances. As part of an initiative to improve overall infrastructure security, the EC2 instances were moved to a private subnet. However, since moving, the EC2 instances have not been able to automatically update, and a SysOps Administrator has not been able to SSH into them remotely. Which two actions could the Administrator take to securely resolve these issues? (Choose two.) A SysOps Administrator wants to prevent Developers from accidentally terminating Amazon EC2 instances. How can this be accomplished? A company is using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) with imported key material. The company references the CMK by its alias in the Java application to encrypt data. The CMK must be rotated every 6 months. What is the process to rotate the key? A company’s static website hosted on Amazon S3 was launched recently, and is being used by tens of thousands of users. Subsequently, website users are experiencing 503 service unavailable errors. Why are these errors occurring? A SysOps Administrator must take a team’s single existing AWS CloudFormation template and split it into smaller, service-specific templates. All of the services in the template reference a single, shared Amazon S3 bucket. What should the Administrator do to ensure that this S3 bucket can be referenced by all the service templates? A SysOps Administrator needs to confirm that security best practices are being followed with the AWS account root user. How should the Administrator ensure that this is done? A company is running multiple AWS Lambda functions in a non-VPC environment. Most of the functions are application-specific; an operational function is involved synchronously every hour. Recently, the Applications team deployed new functions that are triggered based on an Amazon S3 event to process multiple files that are uploaded to an S3 bucket simultaneously. The SysOps Administrator notices that the operational function occasionally fails to execute due to throttling. What step should the Administrator take to make sure that the operational function executes? A SysOps Administrator created an Amazon VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block, which requires access to the internet. However, access from the internet towards the VPC is prohibited. After adding and configuring the required components to the VPC, the Administrator is unable to connect to any of the domains that reside on the internet. What additional route destination rule should the Administrator add to the route tables? A fleet of servers must send local logs to Amazon CloudWatch. How should the servers be configured to meet this requirement? A company using AWS Organizations requires that no Amazon S3 buckets in its production accounts should ever be deleted. What is the SIMPLEST approach the SysOps Administrator can take to ensure S3 buckets in those accounts can never be deleted? A SysOps Administrator implemented the following bucket policy to allow only the corporate IP address range of 54.240.143.0/24 to access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.  Some employees are reporting that they are able to access the S3 bucket from IP addresses outside the corporate IP address range. How can the Administrator address this issue? A company’s Security team wants to track data encryption events across all company AWS accounts. The team wants to capture all AWS KMS events related to deleting or rotating customer master keys (CMKs) from all production AWS accounts. The KMS events will be sent to the Security team’s AWS account for monitoring. How can this be accomplished? A web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and accesses external services. The external services require authentication credentials. The application is deployed using AWS CloudFormation to three separate environments: development, test, and production. Each environment requires unique credentials for external services. What option securely provides the application with the needed credentials while requiring MINIMAL administrative overhead? A SysOps Administrator is responsible for a large fleet of EC2 instances and must know whether any instances will be affected by upcoming hardware maintenance. Which option would provide this information with the LEAST administrative overhead? An application resides on multiple EC2 instances in public subnets in two Availability Zones. To improve security, the Information Security team has deployed an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in separate subnets and pointed the DNS at the ALB instead of the EC2 instances. After the change, traffic is not reaching the instances, and an error is being returned from the ALB. What steps must a SysOps Administrator take to resolve this issue and improve the security of the application? (Choose two.) An HTTP web application is launched on Amazon EC2 instances behind an ELB Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instances run across multiple Availability Zones. A network ACL and a security group for the load balancer and EC2 instances allow inbound traffic on port 80. After launch, the website cannot be reached over the internet.

The Administrator has been tasked with reconfiguring the infrastructure to support this approach. How can the Administrator accomplish this with the LEAST administrative overhead? A company must ensure that any objects uploaded to an S3 bucket are encrypted.  Which of the following actions will meet this requirement? (Choose two.) A web application accepts orders from online users and places the orders into an Amazon SQS queue. Amazon EC2 instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group read the messages from the queue, process the orders, and email order confirmations to the users. The Auto Scaling group scales up and down based on the queue depth. At the beginning of each business day, users report confirmation emails are delayed. What action will address this issue?

What can a SysOps Administrator do to ensure improved read times for users during the social event? A SysOps Administrator is deploying a legacy web application on AWS. The application has four Amazon EC2 instances behind a Classic Load Balancer and stores data in an Amazon RDS instance. The legacy application has known vulnerabilities to SQL injection attacks, but the application code is no longer available to update. What cost-effective configuration change should the Administrator make to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks? A gaming application is deployed on four Amazon EC2 instances in a default VPC. The SysOps Administrator has noticed consistently high latency in responses as data is transferred among the four instances. There is no way for the Administrator to alter the application code. The MOST effective way to reduce latency is to relaunch the EC2 instances in: A SysOps Administrator must generate a report that provides a breakdown of all API activity by a specific user the course of a year. Given that AWS Cloud Trail was enabled, how can this report be generated? A company’s Auditor implemented a compliance requirement that all Amazon S3 buckets must have logging enabled. How should the SysOps Administrator ensure this compliance requirement is met, while still permitting Developers to create and use new S3 buckets?

The company uses one AWS account. There is a need to determine what charges are incurred on the AWS platform by each department. There is also a need to receive notifications when a specified cost level is approached or exceeded. Which two actions must a SysOps Administrator take to achieve both requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative overhead? (Choose two.) An organization is running multiple applications for their customers. Each application is deployed by running a base AWS CloudFormation template that configures a new VPC. All applications are run in the same AWS account and AWS Region. A SysOps Administrator has noticed that when trying to deploy the same AWS CloudFormation stack, it fails to deploy. What is likely to be the problem? A company has attached the following policy to an IAM user.  Which of the following actions are allowed for the IAM user?
