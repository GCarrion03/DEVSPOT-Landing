                    A set of APIs are exposed to customers using the Amazon API Gateway. These APIs have caching enabled on the API Gateway. Customers have asked for an option to invalidate this cache for each of the APIs. What action can be taken to allow API customers to invalidate the API Cache? A Developer must repeatedly and consistently deploy a serverless RESTful API on AWS. Which techniques will work? (Choose two.) A Developer is writing a serverless application that requires that an AWS Lambda function be invoked every 10 minutes. What is an automated and serverless way to trigger the function? An application uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest and process large streams of data records in real time. Amazon EC2 instances consume and process the data from the shards of the Kinesis data stream by using Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL). The application handles the failure scenarios and does not require standby workers. The application reports that a specific shard is receiving more data than expected. To adapt to the changes in the rate of data flow, the “hot” shard is resharded. Assuming that the initial number of shards in the Kinesis data stream is 4, and after resharding the number of shards increased to 6, what is the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be deployed to process data from all the shards? The development team is working on an API that will be served from Amazon API gateway. The API will be served from three environments: development, test, and production. The API Gateway is configured to use 237 GB of cache in all three stages. Which is the MOST cost-efficient deployment strategy? A customer wants to deploy its source code on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment. The customer needs to perform deployment with minimal outage and should only use existing instances to retain application access log. What deployment policy would satisfy these requirements? A gaming company is developing a mobile game application for iOS® and Android® platforms. This mobile game securely stores user data locally on the device. The company wants to allow users to use multiple device for the game, which requires user data synchronization across devices. Which service should be used to synchronize user data across devices without the need to create a  backend application? A Developer wants to encrypt new objects that are being uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket by an application. There must be an audit trail of who has used the key during this process. There should be no change to the performance of the application. Which type of encryption meets these requirements? An application that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance needs to access and make API calls to multiple AWS services. What is the MOST secure way to provide access to the AWS services with MINIMAL management overhead? A serverless application uses an API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Where should the Lambda function store its session information across function calls? An application writes items to an Amazon DynamoDB table. As the application scales to thousands of instances, calls to the DynamoDB API generate occasional ThrottlingException errors. The application is coded in a language incompatible with the AWS SDK. How should the error be handled? An application deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk experiences increased error rates during deployments of new application versions, resulting in service degradation for users. The Development team believes that this is because of the reduction in capacity during the deployment steps. The team would like to change the deployment policy configuration of the environment to an option that maintains full capacity during deployment while using the existing instances. Which deployment policy will meet these requirements while using the existing instances? A company maintains a REST service using Amazon API Gateway and the API Gateway native API key validation. The company recently launched a new registration page, which allows users to sign up for the service. The registration page creates a new API key using CreateApiKey and sends the new key to the user. When the user attempts to call the API using this key, the user receives a 403 Forbidden error. Existing users are unaffected and can still call the API. What code updates will grant these new users access to the API? A game stores user game data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Individual users should not have access to other users’ game data. How can this be accomplished? What are the steps to using the AWS CLI to launch a templatized serverless application? A Developer has an application that can upload tens of thousands of objects per second to Amazon S3 in parallel within a single AWS account. As part of new requirements, data stored in S3 must use server side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). After creating this change, performance of the application is slower. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of the application latency? A Developer has created a software package to be deployed on multiple EC2 instances using IAM roles. What actions could be performed to verify IAM access to get records from Amazon Kinesis Streams? (Choose two.) A Developer is investigating an issue whereby certain requests are passing through an Amazon API Gateway endpoint /MyAPI, but the requests do not reach the AWS Lambda function backing /MyAPI. The Developer found that a second Lambda function sometimes runs at maximum concurrency allowed for the given AWS account. How can the Developer address this issue? To include objects defined by the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) in an AWS CloudFormation template, in addition to Resources, what section MUST be included in the document root? A company is developing an application that will run on several Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group and can access a database running on Amazon EC2. The application needs to store secrets required to connect to the database. The application must allow for periodic secret rotation, and there should be no changes to the application when a secret changes. What is the SAFEST way to meet these requirements? An organization must store thousands of sensitive audio and video files in an Amazon S3 bucket. Organizational security policies require that all data written to this bucket be encrypted. How can compliance with this policy be ensured? An application is expected to process many files. Each file takes four minutes to process each AWS Lambda invocation. The Lambda function does not return any important data. What is the fastest way to process all the files? A legacy service has an XML-based SOAP interface. The Developer wants to expose the functionality of the service to external clients with the Amazon API Gateway. Which technique will accomplish this? A Developer has been asked to create an AWS Lambda function that is triggered any time updates are made to items in an Amazon DynamoDB table. The function has been created, and appropriate permissions have been added to the Lambda execution role. Amazon DynamoDB streams have been enabled for the table, but the function is still not being triggered. Which option would enable DynamoDB table updates to trigger the Lambda function? A Developer is creating a template that uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy an application. This application is serverless and uses Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda. Which tool should the Developer use to define simplified syntax for expressing serverless resources? A Developer wants to find a list of items in a global secondary index from an Amazon DynamoDB table. Which DynamoDB API call can the Developer use in order to consume the LEAST number of read capacity units?

According to best practice, how should access keys be managed in AWS? (Choose two.) A Developer is using AWS CLI, but when running list commands on a large number of resources, it is timing out. What can be done to avoid this time-out? A company developed a set of APIs that are being served through the Amazon API Gateway. The API calls need to be authenticated based on OpenID identity providers such as Amazon or Facebook. The APIs should allow access based on a custom authorization model. Which is the simplest and MOST secure design to use to build an authentication and authorization model for the APIs? An application overwrites an object in Amazon S3, and then immediately reads the same object. Why would the application sometimes retrieve the old version of the object? A Developer is creating a mobile application with a limited budget. The solution requires a scalable service that will enable customers to sign up and authenticate into the mobile application while using the organization’s current SAML 2.0 identity provider. Which AWS service should be used to meet these requirements?  A Developer is creating an application that needs to locate the public IPv4 address of the Amazon EC2 instance on which it runs. How can the application locate this information? After installing the AWS CLI, a Developer tries to run the command aws configure but receives the following error: Error: aws: command not found What is the most likely cause of this error? A Developer wants to use AWS X-Ray to trace a user request end-to-end throughput the software stack. The Developer made the necessary changes in the application tested it, and found that the application is able to send the traces to AWS X-Ray. However, when the application is deployed to an EC2 instance, the traces are not available. Which of the following could create this situation? (Choose two.) An e-commerce site allows returning users to log in to display customized web pages. The workflow is shown in the image below: An application is running on EC2 instances. Amazon RDS is used for the database that stores user  accounts and preferences. The website freezes or is slow to load while waiting for the login step to complete. The remaining components of the site are well-optimized. Which of the following techniques will resolve this issue? (Choose two.) An existing serverless application processes uploaded image files. The process currently uses a single Lambda function that takes an image file, performs the processing, and stores the file in Amazon S3. Users of the application now require thumbnail generation of the images. Users want to avoid any impact to the time it takes to perform the image uploads. How can thumbnail generation be added to the application, meeting user requirements while minimizing changes to existing code? When a Developer tries to run an AWS CodeBuild project, it raises an error because the length of all environment variables exceeds the limit for the combined maximum of characters. What is the recommended solution? In a move toward using microservices, a company’s Management team has asked all Development teams to build their services so that API requests depend only on that service’s data store. One team is building a Payments service which has its own database; the service needs data that originates in the Accounts database. Both are using Amazon DynamoDB. What approach will result in the simplest, decoupled, and reliable method to get near-real time updates from the Accounts database? A company has a multi-tiered web application on AWS. During a recent spike in traffic, one of the primary relational databases on Amazon RDS could not serve all the traffic. Some read queries for repeatedly accessed items failed, so users received error messages. What can be done to minimize the impact on database read queries MOST efficiently during future traffic spikes?  A Development team wants to instrument their code to provide more detailed information to AWS X-Ray than simple outgoing and incoming requests. This will generate large amounts of data, so the Development team wants to implement indexing so they can filter the data. What should the Development team do to achieve this? A Development team would like to migrate their existing application code from a GitHub repository to AWS CodeCommit.

Which AWS CloudFormation template key can be used to specify the correct AMI for each region? A company needs a fully-managed source control service that will work in AWS. The service must ensure that revision control synchronizes multiple distributed repositories by exchanging sets of changes peer-topeer. All users need to work productively even when not connected to a network. Which source control service should be used? A Developer must re-implement the business logic for an order fulfilment system. The business logic has to make requests to multiple vendors to decide where to purchase an item. The whole process can take up to a week to complete. What is the MOST efficient and SIMPLEST way to implement a system that meets these requirements? A deployment package uses the AWS CLI to copy files into any S3 bucket in the account, using access keys stored in environment variables. The package is running on EC2 instances, and the instances have been modified to run with an assumed IAM role and a more restrictive policy that allows access to only one bucket. After the change, the Developer logs into the host and still has the ability to write into all of the S3 buckets in that account. What is the MOST likely cause of this situation? While developing an application that runs on Amazon EC2 in an Amazon VPC, a Developer identifies the need for centralized storage of application-level logs. Which AWS service can be used to securely store these logs? A Developer is designing a fault-tolerant environment where client sessions will be saved. How can the Developer ensure that no sessions are lost if an Amazon EC2 instance fails? A website’s page load times are gradually increasing as more users access the system at the same time. Analysis indicates that a user profile is being loaded from a database in all the web pages being visited by each user and this is increasing the database load and the page load latency. To address this issue the Developer decides to cache the user profile data. Which caching strategy will address this situation MOST efficiently? A Developer is testing a Docker-based application that uses the AWS SDK to interact with Amazon DynamoDB In the local development environment, the application has used IAM access keys.

An application runs on multiple EC2 instances behind an ELB. Where is the session data best written so that it can be served reliably across multiple requests? A Developer needs to design an application running on AWS that will be used to consume Amazon SQS messages that range from 1KB up to 1GB in size. How should the Amazon SQS messages be managed? A large e-commerce site is being designed to deliver static objects from Amazon S3. The Amazon S3 bucket will server more than 300 GET requests per second. What should be done to optimize performance? (Choose two.) A Developer is asked to implement a caching layer in front of Amazon RDS. Cached content is expensive to regenerate in case of service failure. Which implementation below would work while maintaining maximum uptime? A development team consists of 10 team members. Similar to a home directory for each team member, the manager wants to grant access to user-specific folders in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the team member with the username “TeamMemberX”, the snippet of the IAM policy looks like this:  Instead of creating distinct policies for each team member, what approach can be used to make this policy snippet generic for all team members? A web application is designed to allow new users to create accounts using their email addresses. The  application will store attributes for each user, and is expecting millions of user to sign up. What should the Developer implement to achieve the design goals? A company wants to implement authentication for its new REST service using Amazon API Gateway. To authenticate the calls, each request must include HTTP headers with a client ID and user ID. These credentials must be compared to authentication data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. What MUST the company do to implement this authentication in API Gateway? A company has an application that logs all information to Amazon S3. Whenever there is a new log file, an AWS Lambda function is invoked to process the log files. The code works, gathering all of the necessary information. However, when checking the Lambda function logs, duplicate entries with the same request ID are found. What is causing the duplicate entries? A company is migrating from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture. The Developers need to refactor the application so that the many microservices can asynchronously communicate with each other without impacting performance. Use of which managed AWS services will enable asynchronous message passing? (Choose two.) A company is migrating its on-premises database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. The company has readheavy workloads, and wants to make sure it re-factors its code to achieve optimum read performance for its queries. How can this objective be met?

The organization needs a mechanism to index the files and provide single-digit millisecond latency retrieval for the metadata. What AWS service should be used to accomplish this? An application under development is required to store hundreds of video files. The data must be encrypted within the application prior to storage, with a unique key for each video file. How should the Developer code the application? A development team is using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy a two-tier application that consists of a loadbalanced web tier and an Amazon RDS database tier in production. The team would like to separate the RDS instance from the Elastic Beanstalk. How can this be accomplished? A company has written a Java AWS Lambda function to be triggered whenever a user uploads an image to an Amazon S3 bucket. The function converts the original image to several different formats and then copies the resulting images to another Amazon S3 bucket. The Developers find that no images are being copied to the second Amazon S3 bucket. They have tested the code on an Amazon EC2 instance with 1GB of RAM, and it takes an average of 500 seconds to complete. What is the MOST likely cause of the problem? A Developer is creating a mobile application that will not require users to log in.  What is the MOST efficient method to grant users access to AWS resources?

Based on this information, what should the Developer use to autoscale based on concurrent users? A Developer is building a three-tier web application that should be able to handle a minimum of 5000 requests per minute. Requirements state that the web tier should be completely stateless while the application maintains session state for the users. How can session data be externalized, keeping latency at the LOWEST possible value? An application is running on an EC2 instance. The Developer wants to store an application metric in Amazon CloudWatch. What is the best practice for implementing this requirement? A company is building a stock trading application that requires sub-millisecond latency in processing trading requests. Amazon DynamoDB is used to store all the trading data that is used to process each request. After load testing the application, the development team found that due to data retrieval times, the latency requirement is not satisfied. Because of sudden high spikes in the number of requests, DynamoDB read capacity has to be significantly over-provisioned to avoid throttling. What steps should be taken to meet latency requirements and reduce the cost of running the application? A Developer is creating a Lambda function that will generate and export a file. The function requires 100 MB of temporary storage for temporary files while executing. These files will not be needed after the function is complete.

How should a Developer instrument the code so that the requirement can be met? A Developer uses AWS CodeDeploy to automate application deployment that connects to an external MySQL database. The Developer wants to securely access the encrypted secrets, such as API keys and database passwords. Which of the following solutions would involve the LEAST administrative effort? A company is providing services to many downstream consumers. Each consumer may connect to one or more services. This has resulted in a complex architecture that is difficult to manage and does not scale well. The company needs a single interface to manage these services to consumers. Which AWS service should be used to refactor this architecture? A Developer wants to upload data to Amazon S3 and must encrypt the data in transit. Which of the following solutions will accomplish this task? (Choose two.)  A current architecture uses many Lambda functions invoking one another as large state machine.

The application must be fault tolerant, natively highly scalable, and any service interruption should not affect the user experience. What is the best option to store the session state? A Developer wants access to make the log data of an application running on an EC2 instance available to systems administrators. Which of the following enables monitoring of this metric in Amazon CloudWatch? A Developer must build an application that uses Amazon DynamoDB. The requirements state that the items being stored in the DynamoDB table will be 7KB in size and that reads must be strongly consistent. The maximum read rate is 3 items per second, and the maximum write rate is 10 items per second. How should the Developer size the DynamoDB table to meet these requirements?

The Developer does not want to manage a back end to maintain the user profile data. What is the MOST efficient way for the Developer to achieve these requirements using Amazon Cognito? A Developer is storing sensitive documents in Amazon S3 that will require encryption at rest. The encryption keys must be rotated annually, at least. What is the easiest way to achieve this? An application displays a status dashboard. The status is updated by 1 KB messages from an SQS queue. Although the status changes infrequently, the Developer must minimize the time between the message arrival in the queue and the dashboard update. What technique provides the shortest delay in updating the dashboard? A Development team has pushed out 10 applications running on several Amazon EC2 instances. The Operations team is asking for a graphical representation of one key performance metric for each application. These metrics should be available on one screen for easy monitoring. Which steps should the Developer take to accomplish this using Amazon CloudWatch? A company runs an e-commerce website that uses Amazon DynamoDB where pricing for items is dynamically updated in real time.

How can this deployment be automated, based on these requirements? A Developer accesses AWS CodeCommit over SSH. The SSH keys configured to access AWS CodeCommit are tied to a user with the following permissions:  The Developer needs to create/delete branches. Which specific IAM permissions need to be added, based on the principle of least privilege? Where should an Elastic Beanstalk configuration file named healthcheckur1.config be placed in the application source bundle? An Amazon RDS database instance is used by many applications to look up historical data. The query rate is relatively constant. When the historical data is updated each day, the resulting write traffic slows the read query performance and affects all application users. What can be done to eliminate the performance impact on application users?  A stock market monitoring application uses Amazon Kinesis for data ingestion.
