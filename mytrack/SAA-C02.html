A university is running an internal web application on AWS that students can access from the university network to check their exam results. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and pulls results from an Amazon DynamoDB table. Auto Scaling is currently Configured to add a new web server when CPU is greater than 80% for 5 minutes. DynamoDB is Configured to increase both read and write capacity units by ve when utilization is greater than 80%. Exam results are released at 9:00 a.m. each Monday, and 80% of students, attempt to access their unique result within the rest 30 minutes. Despite Auto Scaling being enabled, students are complaining of slow response times and errors when they view the site.

What is the SIMPLEST solution? A Solutions Architect must review an application deployed on EC2 instances that currently stores multiple 5-GB files on attached instance store volumes. The company recently experienced a significant data loss after stopping and starting their instances and wants to prevent the data loss from happening again. The solution should minimize performance impact and the number of code changes required. What should the Solutions Architect recommend? A company has an application that generates invoices and makes the invoices available online. Invoices are stored as PDFs in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Which service should the Architect use to achieve this goal with the LEAST administrative effort? An application produces monthly reports that must be immediately accessible for up to 7 days. After 7 days, the data can be archived. Compliance policies require that the archived data be retrievable within 24 hours of a request. What is the MOST cost-effective approach to satisfy the compliance requirement?

However, these application servers are in an Auto Scaling group and may vary in quantity. How should the Architect Configure the database servers to meet the requirements? A call center application consists of a three - tier application using Auto Scaling groups to automatically scale resources as needed. Users report that every morning at 9:00 AM the system becomes very slow for about 15 minutes.A Solution Architect determines that a large percentage of the call center staff starts work at 9:00 AM,so Auto Scaling does not have enough time to scale out to meet demand.How can the Architect x the problem?

The Marketing team does not want to manage deployment of OS patches to the Linux servers. Use of which AWS service will satisfy these requirements? A customer owns a MySQL database that is accessed by various clients who expect, at most, 100 ms latency on requests. Once a record is stored in the database, it rarely changed. Clients only access one record at a time. Database access has been increasing exponentially due to increased client demand. The resultant load will soon exceed the capacity of the most expensive hardware available for purchase. The customer wants to migrate to AWS, and is willing to change database systems. Which service would alleviate the database load issue and offer virtually unlimited scalability for the future? An application stores data in an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ database instance. The ratio of read requests to write requests is about 2 to 1. Recent increases in traffic are causing very high latency. How can this problem be corrected? An e-commerce application is hosted in AWS. The last time a new product was launched, the application experienced a performance issue due to an enormous spike in traffic. Management decided that capacity must be doubled the week after the product is launched. Which is the MOST efficient way for management to ensure that capacity requirements are met?
