For infrequently accessed data, sc1 provides extremely inexpensive storage. SC1 is designed to deliver the expected throughput performance 99% of the time and has enough I/O credits to support a full-volume scan at the burst rate.Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/features/"

CloudTrail log file integrity validation uses industry standard algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 withRSA for digital signing. This makes it computationally unfeasible to modify, delete or forge CloudTrail log files without detection. TConfiguring multi-factor authentication (MFA) ensures that any attempt to change the versioning state of your bucket or permanently delete an object version requires additional authentication. This helps prevent any operation that could compromise the integrity of your log files, even if a user acquires the password of an IAM user that has permissions to permanently delete Amazon S3 objects.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/best-practices-security.html"
